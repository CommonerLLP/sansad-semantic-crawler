"""Name + context -> entity_id resolver.

Single function: ``Resolver.resolve(name, context, kind_hint) -> ResolutionResult``.

The resolver is the chokepoint between unstructured text (a name as it
appears in a question record, a witness list, a committee composition)
and the structured entity store. Every consumer that needs to attach
an ``entity_id`` to a record goes through this function.

Behaviour on unresolvable names (option (a) from PLAN_v0.5.0_SCOPE.md):
ambiguous lookups return ``status="ambiguous"`` with a candidates list
and ``entity_id=None``. Callers stamp the null on the record and proceed.
Manual review later. **No placeholder entities** — orphan records that
ossify are worse than honest nulls.

Bureaucrat resolution is deferred in v0.5.0: ``kind_hint="bureaucrat"``
returns ``status="deferred"`` immediately. The schema and call site are
in place; the implementation lands in v0.6.0 with DoPT data piping.
