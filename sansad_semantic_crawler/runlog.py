"""Per-run audit log: makes categorical apparatus travel with the corpus.

Every crawl appends one record to ``<out>/_runs.jsonl``. Each record pins:

* a run id (uuid4) so individual records in ``manifest.jsonl`` can be linked
  to the run that produced them via the ``run_id`` field;
* the topic profile's content hash and classifier configuration (with
  secrets redacted), so a future reader can verify which categorical
  apparatus produced which records;
* scope (committees, houses, date filters, Lok Sabha number);
* outcome (added, errors).

This is the architectural answer to two pressures:

* Suchman (*Do Categories Have Politics?*): tag rules and anchors are
  theories of speech, not neutral filters. The theory must be inseparable
  from the data it produced.
* Power (*Making Things Auditable*): "audit-grade" only means anything if
  the apparatus that did the auditing is itself inspectable.

JSONL purity in ``manifest.jsonl`` is preserved — runs go to a sibling file.
